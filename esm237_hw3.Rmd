Variables needed:
t_air - air temperature (in celsius)
t_d - dew point temperature (in celsius)
rh - relative humidity (%)

"Daily mean and daily maximum temperatures have been used to calculate a corresponding daily mean and daily maximum apparent temperature."

Variables derived:

1. Apparent temperature (at)
at = (-2.653 + 0.994) * (t_air + 0.0153) * (t_d)^2


2. Humidex (hx)

2.a. vapor pressure of water v (in hPa)

v = (6.112 × 10ˆ(7.5 * t_air/(237.7 + t_air)) * rh/100) 

2.b. humidex
hx = t_air + (v-10) * (5/9)



"A Humidex of less than 29 means no discomfort; 30 to 39 some discomfort; 40 to 45 great discomfort and avoid exertion; and above 45 is dangerous, heat stroke is possible."
